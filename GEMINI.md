## Guidelines for GEMINI Code Contributions

### 1. Precision and Clarity
- Write code that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Add comments where logic may not be immediately obvious.

### 2. Bug Prevention
- Proactively look for potential bugs or edge cases.
- Validate inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.
- Use assertions or checks to catch unexpected states.

### 3. Logging and Debugging
- Add logging at key points (e.g., function entry/exit, error handling).
- Ensure logs provide enough context to trace issues.
- Avoid excessive or redundant logging.

### 4. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Is the code precise and do what it needs to do?
- [ ] Are potential bugs or edge cases addressed?
- [ ] Are logs added where necessary for debugging?
- [ ] Are comments and up to date?
